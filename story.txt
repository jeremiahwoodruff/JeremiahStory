There once was a girl named Ava.
Toasters were Avas most favorite thing in the world.
She had one dream, to own the worlds first sentient toaster.
One day she left to find the magical toaster genie to make her wish come true.
On her journey to ToasterLand, where the genie lived, she found many different kinds of toasters. Some ran on 30 Watts, some on 40, some had automatic popup systems and some didn't. But she still hadn't found a sentient toaster. Then one day, she stumbled upon the Toaster Sherpa.
